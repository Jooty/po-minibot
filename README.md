# po-minibot

a script to automate minigames in Pirates of The Caribbean Online

pretty intuitive. currently only works on the hardest difficulty minigames near the shipwright. you can AFK it to make ~6,000 gold per hour

### todo
* hull scrubbing minigame is *really* slow
* bilge pumping so it works on ships
* the only thing stopping this from working on other difficulties is the hull bracing minigame. the script only pathfinds two rows, and two rows are only present on the hard difficulty
* i think a blackjack bot would be funny
* i think a poker bot would be funny
