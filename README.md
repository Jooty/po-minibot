# po-minibot
a script to automate minigames in Pirates of The Caribbean Online

pretty intuitive. currently only works on the hardest difficulty minigames near the shipwright. you can AFK it to make ~6,000 gold per hour

### forewarning
this script is not a cheat. it does not attach to the game client and instead takes screenshots of your game to understand things.

the script expects a 1920x1080 screen and the game in 60fps. 

### todo
* hull scrubbing minigame is *really* slow
* bilge pumping so it works on ships
* the only thing stopping this from working on other difficulties is the hull bracing minigame. the script only pathfinds two rows, and two rows are only present on the hard difficulty
* i think a blackjack bot would be funny
* i think a poker bot would be funny
